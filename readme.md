This repository contains the code used in the self selected topic of
Sondre Hølleland, during his phd education at the University of Bergen.
Due to the corona pandemic, the seminar was held digitally on zoom and
Sondre decided to record his seminar. Durin this period, the
hairdressers were shut down, explaining the hair situation. You find the
slides in the presentation folder and all the code used in the Code
folder.

downloaded from [norron-mytologi.info](htts://norron-mytologi.info) and
is made by an unkown artist.
